# Energy_Consumption_Forecasting
Energy consumption forecasting is an important area of study in many fields, including environmental science, economics, and business. It involves predicting future energy usage patterns based on historical data, weather conditions, and other relevant factors. Accurate forecasting of energy demand can help utility companies optimize their resources, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure a reliable supply of energy.

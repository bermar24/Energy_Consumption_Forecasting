# Energy_Consumption_Forecasting
Energy consumption forecasting is an important area of study in many fields, including environmental science, economics, and business. It involves predicting future energy usage patterns based on historical data, weather conditions, and other relevant factors. Accurate forecasting of energy demand can help utility companies optimize their resources, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure a reliable supply of energy.
In your project, you can focus on predicting energy consumption for a specific region or facility (e.g., a building or an entire city) based on historical usage data, weather patterns, time of day, and possibly other external factors like holidays or special events.

>[!NOTE]
>The goal is to develop a model that can predict future energy consumption (electricity, gas, or other types of energy) based on the historical data and external factors.
